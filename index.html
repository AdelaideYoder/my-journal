    <p>Today has been an introduction day. Lots of Console Commands to understand. 
        Tried to create shortcuts which are called aliases. Learned about Git and GitHub
        but definitely still struggling. I wasn't completely lost but didn't understand 
        everything. All in all, a good day. </p>

    <h3>Tuesday, May 22, 2018</h3>
    <p>Today was an interesting day. We started by creating a new repository on GitHub. There is a lot to remember for this. Before you start doing anything in Visual Studio Code, you have to go to your Terminal and make sure you are in your Workspace so that you can then create a new directory. </p>
        <ol id="orderList">
            <li>Create New Repository on GitHub</li>
            <li>Go to Terminal</li>
            <li>Make sure you are in your Workspace Directory</li>
            <li>Create a new directory (example: mkdir my-journal)</li>
            <li>Then cd into your new directory</li>
            <li>At this point you could go ahead and do 'git init'</li>
            <li>Then create your main files using the 'touch' command</li>
            <li>DO NOT FORGET your README.md file</li>
            <li>Files you need: README.md, index.html, main.css, main.js</li>
            <li>Using 'git status' is helpful to make sure you are on the right path</li>
            <li>Then use 'git add' to add all of your new files</li>
            <li>Then use the 'code .' command to open up all of these in Visual Studio Code</li>
            <li>Now that you are in Visual Studio Code editor, open up your index.html file</li>
            <li>Use the '! (bang) - tab' to add in the HTML</li>
            <li>Then connect your main.css and main.js files to your HTML file</li>
            <li>NOTE: The CSS file needs to be added in the HEAD tag</li>
            <li>NOTE: The JavaScript file needs to be added in a Script Tag at the end of your HTML file right before the closing body tag</li>

        </ol>

    <p>There were also group presentations from the Cohort that is about 7 weeks ahead of us. It was very interesting. They were presenting their Nutshell project. </p>
