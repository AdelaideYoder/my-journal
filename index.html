    <p>Today has been an introduction day. Lots of Console Commands to understand. 
        Tried to create shortcuts which are called aliases. Learned about Git and GitHub
        but definitely still struggling. I wasn't completely lost but didn't understand 
        everything. All in all, a good day. </p>

    <p>Day two has started. </p>
